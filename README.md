This the repository for assignment 3. The code in the tourist_visits file is an example, it will need to be modified and connected to the chosen data.

If you don't know how to use git and github, they have documentation for beginners: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey

Since we have a mixture of git knowledge, everyone should make their own branch and do their feature in it. To create a branch:

```
git branch ellina
```

To push a branch to github

```
git push origin ellina
```

Once everyone has finished their work in their branch, we will merge it all together. After that, future work can be on main or on a branch as you desire.
